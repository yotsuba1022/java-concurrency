# Synchronizers

Java provides the synchronized keyword for synchronizing thread access to critical
sections. Because it can be difficult to correctly write synchronized code thatâ€™s based on
synchronized, high-level synchronizers (classes that facilitate common forms of
synchronization) are included in the concurrency utilities.

* Countdown Latches
    * A countdown latch causes one or more threads to wait at a "gate" until another thread
      opens this gate, at which point these other threads can continue. It consists of a count and
      operations for "causing a thread to wait until the count reaches zero" and "decrementing
      the count."

    * The java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch class implements the countdown latch synchronizer.
      You initialize a CountDownLatch instance to a specific count by invoking this class's
      CountDownLatch(int count) constructor
