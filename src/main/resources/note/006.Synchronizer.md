# Synchronizers

Java provides the synchronized keyword for synchronizing thread access to critical
sections. Because it can be difficult to correctly write synchronized code that’s based on
synchronized, high-level synchronizers (classes that facilitate common forms of
synchronization) are included in the concurrency utilities.

* Countdown Latches
    * A countdown latch causes one or more threads to wait at a "gate" until another thread
      opens this gate, at which point these other threads can continue. It consists of a count and
      operations for "causing a thread to wait until the count reaches zero" and "decrementing
      the count."

    * The java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch class implements the countdown latch synchronizer.
      You initialize a CountDownLatch instance to a specific count by invoking this class's
      CountDownLatch(int count) constructor

* Cyclic Barriers
    * A cyclic barrier lets a set of threads wait for each other to reach a common barrier point.
      The barrier is cyclic because it can be reused after the waiting threads are released. This
      synchronizer is useful in applications involving a fixed-size party of threads that must
      occasionally wait for each other.

    * The java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier class implements the cyclic barrier synchronizer.
      You initialize a CyclicBarrier instance to a specific number of parties (threads working toward
      a common goal) by invoking this class’s CyclicBarrier(int parties) constructor.

    * You can also invoke the CyclicBarrier(int parties, Runnable barrierAction) constructor to initialize
      a cyclic barrier to a specific number of parties and a barrierAction that's executed when the barrier
      is tripped. In other words, when (parties - 1) threads are waiting and one more thread arrives,
      the arriving thread executes barrierAction and then all threads proceed. This runnable is useful
      for updating shared state before any of the threads continue.

    * Cyclic barriers are useful in parallel decomposition scenarios, where a lengthy task is
      divided into subtasks whose individual results are later merged into the overall result of
      the task.

* Exchangers
    * An exchanger provides a synchronization point where threads can swap objects. Each
      thread presents some object on entry to the exchanger's exchange() method, matches
      with a partner thread, and receives its partner's object on return.

    * The generic java.util.concurrent.Exchanger<V> class implements the exchanger
      synchronizer. You can initialize an exchanger by invoking the Exchanger() constructor.

    * To perform an exchange, invoke V exchange(V x) method. It means Wait for another thread to arrive at this
      exchange point (unless the calling thread is interrupted), and then transfer the given object to it,
      receiving the other thread's object in return. If another thread is already waiting at the exchange point,
      it's resumed for thread-scheduling purposes and receives the object passed in by the calling thread.
      The current thread returns immediately, receiving the object passed to the exchanger by the other thread.
