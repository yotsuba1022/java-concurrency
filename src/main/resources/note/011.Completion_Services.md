# Completion Services

* A completion service is an implementation of the java.util.concurrent.
  CompletionService<V> interface that decouples the production of new asynchronous
  tasks (a producer) from the consumption of the results of completed tasks (a consumer).
  V is the type of a task result.

* A producer submits a task for execution (via a worker thread) by calling one of the
  submit() methods: one method accepts a callable argument and the other method accepts a
  runnable argument along with a result to return upon task completion. Each method returns
  a Future<V> instance that represents the pending completion of the task. You can then call a
  poll() method to poll for the task's completion or call the blocking take() method.

* A consumer takes a completed task by calling the take() method. This method
  blocks until a task has completed. It then returns a Future<V> object that represents the
  completed task. You would call Future<V>'s get() method to obtain this result.

* Along with CompletionService<V>, Java 7 introduced the java.util.concurrent.
  ExecutorCompletionService<V> class to support task execution via a provided executor.
  This class ensures that, when submitted tasks are complete, they are placed on a queue
  thatâ€™s accessible to take().
